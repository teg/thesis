In this thesis we introduce a geometric language for describing normal
forms of proofs, which we call atomic flows. We define new normal
forms for propositional logic proofs in deep inference, of which the
traditional normal forms are special cases. Using atomic flows we
provide several normalisation procedures for obtaining the normal
forms. To our surprise we can 1) normalise proofs without looking at
their logical connectives or logical rules; and 2) normalise proofs in
less than exponential time.
